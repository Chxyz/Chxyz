## What is Markdown ?

Markdown is a syntax language aiming for easy reading and writing of structured text. 

It is used all across the internet: On [GitHub](https://github.com) of course, on every major blogging platform, in note taking apps and many more.

Markdown's file extension is `.md` or `.markdown`.  
Inside, there is only text. So you could rename a text file (`file.txt`) with the Markdown file extension (`file.md`) and still be able to read it. Same for `.md` to `.txt`.

## Markdown Features

The [Markdown syntax][Markdown official doc] supports the following features:

- Paragraphs and line breaks
- Headers
- Lists
- Emphasis
- Code blocks
- Links
- Images
- Quotes
- Tables
- Horizontal rule

By using just these features you can write out almost any document you could with MS Word.

> Note that markdown *"supports"* HTML, so you will be able to do much more!

### Benefits

- **Easy**  
It's pure text and has only few features, you can learn the syntax in few minutes.  
Limited features also means, most of the time, more readable and structured output.

- **Fast**  
You can focus on the content instead of the design / style.

- **Multi-platform**  
It only requires a text editor.

- **Version control**  
It's like code files: it can be put in a versioning system.  
For example: directly in the application project folder.

- **Light**  
Convenient for emails: to have a light attached document.

- **Exportability**  
It can be exported in many formats with a lot open source tools.

### Comparison with *Microsoft Word*

- **MS Word is good!** - For complicated document, MS Word would be better. But documentations should be simple to read, right..?
- **Time is expensive!** - To make the same document, you will need to take more time, in MS Word, to add formatting. For big documents you can waste lot of time just to make your document look nice.
- **Take my money! Or not...** - You need to purchase a license to have Microsoft Word. Of course there is free alternatives but it can bring compatibility issues or mess with the formatting when sharing documents.
- **Size matters!** - For the same document, the Markdown file size can be less than 1% the MS Word file size.
- **World Wide Web!** - Both Markdown and Word documents can be exported in many different formats. But Markdown could easily be integrated in a web page.
- **I love code!** - Adding source code lines in Markdown is very easy. In MS Word it's a bit tricky.

### Conclusion

*Everything is relative!*  
For some things it could be better to use MS Word for other things Markdown.

But the most important point is to spend as less time as possible writing documentation but still get comprehensive result. And that's where Markdown is the best in his category.  
At least for software documentation, the features Markdown offers are enough to write everything you need.

Then, the only downside would be for some people to learn how to write Markdown.  
But it is so simple you will spend the same time learning it and writing the document than to write the same document in MS Word.

Anyway, don't be afraid and give it a shot, it could really make you enjoy writing stuff again!
